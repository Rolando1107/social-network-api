This is a starter backend for a social network site. It contains api routes and controllers for allowing communication between a node.js server and a mongoDB database containing user data and 'thoughts' by those users, while allowing for users to add to their friends list and react to thoughts.

## Installation
To install, clone down the repository. You will need to to remove the '.example' from 'env.example' and add your mongoDB uri to it in order to deploy, though this will not be necessary for developing locally.

## Usage
To use locally, open the root directory in the terminal and use 'npm run start' to transpile the code into js and start the database and server. From there, routes can be tested via localhost:3001.

A demonstration of testing api endpoints can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/v/c/9b5bc19b15615740/EdkSuM4A4a5Fu2jKa76Rp1cBeYADA52Zgf6dos6TP9ufOg?e=umLPn6)
